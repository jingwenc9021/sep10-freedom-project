           <p> Cosmetics are used to beautify, maintain or change the appearance
           Cosmetics are products used to improve physical appearance in terms of cleanliness and appearance. This name applies to products for topical use, that is, products for hair, skin, nails and mouth. Cosmetics contain a mixture of 15 to 50 ingredients. The amount and type of substances used will depend on the type of cosmetics, the body part that will be used in it and its service life (may be as long as 3 months to 3 years). Generally, the most common ingredients in cosmetics are as follows: Water: Used in liquid products. Grease: Used in creams or crayons. Alcohol: Contains certain minerals. Paint: Give color.

            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p> In the past, people would apply animal fats to the skin to make their skin color look healthy and shiny. This is also the earliest skin care behavior. Early skin care products and cosmetics originated in the chemical industry. At that time, it was difficult to extract naturally from plants, and the petrochemical synthesis industry was very developed. Therefore, the raw materials of many skin care products and cosmetics come from the chemical industry, and there are still many international and domestic brands that still use the raw materials of that era. The price is low, the raw materials are relatively simple, and the cost is low. Therefore, the era of mineral oil is also the era of daily chemicals.</p>

                  <h3> -what the different types of cosmetics?</h3>
                  <p> Although there are a large number of different cosmetics used for a variety of different purposes, all cosmetics are usually for external use. These products can be used on the face (skin, lips, eyebrows and eyes), body (skin, especially hands and nails) and hair. These products can be used for skin care, personal care or appearance modification. The subset of cosmetics referred to by cosmetics mainly refers to products containing color pigments designed to change the appearance of the wearer; some manufacturers only distinguish between "decorative" cosmetics and "care" cosmetics for skin care and personal care. Most cosmetics are also distinguished by their applicable body parts. Cosmetics for the face and eyes are usually applied with a brush, makeup sponge or fingertips.
